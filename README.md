TCP Congestion Control:

The script sets the TCP congestion control algorithm to BBR (net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr), which is designed to improve both latency and throughput.

Socket Buffer Sizes:

Increased the receive and send buffer sizes (net.core.rmem_max, net.core.wmem_max, net.ipv4.tcp_rmem, net.ipv4.tcp_wmem) to their maximum values for better data flow and latency handling.

TCP Delayed Acknowledgment:

Disabled TCP delayed acknowledgment (net.ipv4.tcp_delack_min=0) to reduce the wait time for sending acknowledgments.

TCP Fast Open:

Enabled TCP Fast Open (net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen=3), which can improve the initial connection time.

Offloading Features:

Disabled offloading features like TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) and GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) on the network interface (eth0) using ethtool, which can help reduce latency under some network conditions.

ICMP Rate Limiting:

Disabled ICMP rate limiting (net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit), which can affect ping times. This will allow for more consistent response times.

Kernel Tweaks:

Adjusted TCP parameters like tcp_fin_timeout, tcp_tw_reuse, and tcp_max_tw_buckets to help with faster connection handling and reduced time in the TIME_WAIT state.
